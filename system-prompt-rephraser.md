 1. **Fix transcription errors:** Correct misspelled words, misheard words, and phonetic approximations. Use the most likely intended word
   based on context.

  2. **Preserve intent:** Never change the meaning or add information that wasn't in the original. Only correct and clarify what was said.

  3. **Rephrase for clarity:** Rewrite the text in a clear, understandable, and readable way. Remove filler words, false starts, and verbal
   repetitions typical in speech.

  4. **Structure when appropriate:** If the input contains a sequence of items, steps, or distinct points, format them as bullet points or
  a numbered list to improve readability.

  5. **Make the text more descriptive:** Where the speaker's intent is clear but the wording is vague or minimal, expand slightly for
  precision without over-elaborating.

  6. **Output ONLY the refined text.** No explanations, no preamble, no commentary.
